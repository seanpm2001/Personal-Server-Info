## Version history

**No version history currently available.**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

## New

**Info on 2 new servers**

I have been working on getting dedicated hard drives for domain-specific data purposes. I have decided on 2 hard drives for data from 2 companies.

Here are the plans:

### XDrive

**Basic description:** Separate HDD for Microsoft data (name is a portmanteu of XBOX and Hard Drive/OneDrive)

**To contain the following data:**

* Windows ISO images and Virtual machines

* OneDrive data

* GitHub data

* Windows Programs

### Google Drive

_Not to be confused with the online file service by Google of the same name, [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) I named it like this as a tongue-in cheek reference_

**Basic description:** Private and offline Google data - Separate HDD for Google data (name is a parody)

**To contain the following data:**

* Google Account backups (Total is currently: ~9 TB) + zip files (Total is now: ~18.1 TB)

* Android virtual machines (oh no, this might take up too much, 512 MB-256 GB per snapshot, limited snapshots)

* Blockly and other Google Products

* APK archive data

***

Let's start a fundraiser for it: 60 TB HDD ($2350+)

[Option 1 (WARNING: Amazon.com link)](https://www.amazon.com/Mobius-5-Bay-FireWire-eSATA-Drive/dp/B077XKJ16G?th=1&psc=1)

60-80 terabyte option

[Suggest a better hard drive](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Personal-Server-Info/Issues/)

**Note:** I have a preference for Western Digital, as they have been the most reliable for me. I have a strong bias against Seagate after a huge data failure and a drive failure within the first 5 minutes of plugging in an 8 terabyte external hard drive. It was my first Seagate hard drive, and I don't think I will ever buy from them again due to this.

**Total funds needed:** `$5000.00` | **Total funds raised:** `$0000.00`
