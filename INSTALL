This project currently doesn't have to be installed to be viewed, and currently doesn't require installation, it is a basic information project, and will work if you clone the project and view it in a markdown viewer. Images may not work if you don't have the correct parameters.

If you want to run the main project language file, you will need support for the BASH shell. Almost all Linux distributions since 1999 support running Bash in some way, such as through zsh, Vim, ksh, GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Emacs, and many, many more.

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in JPG format. Make sure your computer can handle images of 2560x1440/2560x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle JPG files.

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, and PNG. You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.
