# Hard drive 1AD-A points of interest

This is my sixth external hard drive (Codenamed Ada Price, since its initals are AD-A (Ada) and it came from Price Computers LLC) It has been restricted to emergency hard drive backups and device data configuration only. In other words, it is used as the drive that holds all the main data to put onto the preferred device, but not used as a new backup tool.
Use range: `2020-present`

Capacity: `2 Terabytes (20,00 Gigabytes (2,000,000 Megabytes (2,000,000,000 Kilobytes (2,000,000,000,000 bytes))))`

Provider: `WD (Western Digital)`

Color: `Black`

Points of interest:

* Contains a copy of all main files needed to setup a personal Seanpm2001 device (app data, packages, journaling, music, video, documents, pictures, etc.) data is swapped out for each new backup onto brand new/restored devices.
