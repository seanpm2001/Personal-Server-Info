# Hard Disk Drive Points of Interest

This section is for my external hard drives, containing their ID, codename, purpose, capacity, color, and other specifications. These drives will eventually be replaced with Solid State Drive equivalents in the near future, and this list will just be past drives.

There currently are 6 hard drives in this list (as of May 15th 2021) ranging from a capacity of 1 terabyte to 10 terabytes each (1, 2, 4, 8, 10)

## Index

Here is an Index of the current hard drives. This list is sorted by size, number, and type in 3 separate listings.

### 1 terabyte

AA - The original external hard drive, my very first one (Western Digital)

### 2 terabyte

AD-A - My 6th external hard drive, from [Price Computers LLC](http://www.pricecomputersllc.com/) used solely as a backup device (Western Digital)

### 4 terabyte

AB - My 2nd external hard drive, and my first 4 terabyte external hard drive. Still running 4+ years later (Western Digital)

AC - My 4th external hard drive, and my 2nd 4 terabyte drive. (Western Digital)

### 8 terabyte

AB-A - My 3rd external hard drive, and my first failed drive, a 8 terabyte Seagate drive. Failed within 15 minutes of opening on Christmas day (Seagate)

### 10 terabyte

AD - My 5th external hard drive, and my first 10 terabyte external drive. Also my 2nd external hard drive to also require a power source (something I was skeptical of after the Seagate failure) this hard drive is still in use and is still my largest one (as of May 15th 2021) (Western Digital)

## Drive functionality

All functional drives are Western Digital Drives (5x) all non-functional drives are Seagate drives (1x) this was the drive that made me learn that Seagate is a very bad hard drive manufacturer, as my first Seagate drive failed within 5 minutes, and I have since researched the significant failure rate of Seagate drives. I prefer and trust Western Digital now, as they are the manufacturer of the drives I have had for years, and none of them have failed yet (for over 10 years and counting for 1 hard drive (not yet listed) and 1 week-4 years and counting for the other 5)
